These circuits are desinged using KiCad 6.  
In order to order multiple boards at the same time, we will copy the wiring on the PCB editor. Since the number of parts differs from the circuit diagram, repainting the wiring will result in many errors and unconnected wiring. Please be careful when ordering board production.  
Links for NeoPixel modules are provided in LED-module.csv.
